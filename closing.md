# Closing questions

These are some possible questions to use at the end of a storytelling session to end or wrap-up the discussion. You may find yourself pressed for time at the end of a session, so be prepared to improvise!

* Do you have any parting thoughts or words of advice for our listeners?
* From your perspective, what are some of the biggest challenges in open source?
* What do you see as open source's greatest potential?
* Where do you hope to see in the world of open source in the next 5-10 years?
* Do you see yourself staying involved in open source long-term?
* What are you most proud of in your open source work so far?
* Is there anything else you'd like to share with us today?
