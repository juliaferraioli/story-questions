# Opening questions

These are some possible questions to use at the beginning of a storytelling session to ease into the story, give some color to the participants, or otherwise break the ice. Please do not feel limited to these questions!

* What was your first experience with / memory of a computer (or other technology)?
* What is your favorite movie?
* What was the first computer (or video) game you played?
* What brings you joy at the moment?
