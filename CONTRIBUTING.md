# Contributing to the Open Source Stories questions

Open Source Stories looks forward to your contributions! If you have a question
that you'd like to add to one of our lists, you have a few options:

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/opensourcestories/story-questions/issues/new/choose)
with the question or theme that you'd like to add
1. [Open a pull request](https://github.com/opensourcestories/story-questions/compare)
with the question or theme added in your changes

## Submitting your pull request

If you want to contribute by opening a pull request, please note that we follow
[The GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) model of
contributing.

We are not picky about commit messages, but please try to add a somewhat
sensible pull request title.

For instance, instead of using "Add opening question" as your commit message or
pull request title, use "Add question about _x_ to the opening questions".

## Disclosure

By submitting an issue or pull request to this repository, you are
acknowledging that your question may be used in future storytelling sessions.
However, it is not a guarantee that it **will** be used.
